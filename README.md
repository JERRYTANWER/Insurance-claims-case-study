DATA EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING FOR INSURANCE CLAIMS DATA

This repository contains code and documentation for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing on insurance claims data.

**Overview**
The goal of this project is to analyze insurance claims data to gain insights into customer behavior, claim patterns, and potential relationships between different variables. The dataset consists of two CSV files: 'claims_data.csv' and 'cust_data.csv'.

**Project Structure**
* data: Directory containing the raw data files ('claims_data.csv' and 'cust_data.csv').
* scripts: Directory containing Python scripts for data analysis.
  * 'data_preparation.py': Combines and preprocesses the data, performs data auditing, and handles missing values.
  * 'feature_engineering.py': Creates new features such as age categories and alert flags.
  * 'analysis.py': Conducts exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing.
* visualizations: Directory containing visualizations generated from the analysis.
* README.md: Detailed information about the project, including instructions for setup and usage.

**Results**

* **EDA**: Exploratory data analysis reveals insights into customer demographics, claim amounts, and trends over time.
* **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical tests are conducted to examine relationships between variables and validate assumptions.


**Conclusion**

The analysis provides valuable insights for insurance companies to understand customer behavior, identify potential fraud, and optimize claim processing. Further analysis and machine learning models could be developed to improve decision-making and risk assessment.
